Macroeconomic and Financial Risks: A Tale of Volatility
Dario Caldara, Chiara Scotti, and Molin Zhong

We construct indicators of uncertainty and risk using a stochastic volatility VAR that generates comovements in mean and volatility and, therefore, time-variation 
and asymmetries in the distributions of future macroeconomic and financial variables. The model, estimated with Bayesian techniques and real-time data, points to a 
rich correlation structure among measures of uncertainty and risk in both macroeconomic and financial conditions.
